# Python Ping Pong Game

A simple implementation of the classic Ping Pong game using Python's Turtle graphics module.

## Description

This project is a two-player Ping Pong game created with Python's Turtle module. It demonstrates basic game development concepts including:

- Game loop implementation
- Player input handling
- Collision detection
- Score tracking

## How to Play

- Player 1:
  - Move paddle up: 'W' key
  - Move paddle down: 'S' key
- Player 2:
  - Move paddle up: Up arrow key
  - Move paddle down: Down arrow key
- The game ends when one player reaches 10 points

### Project Breakdown: Simple Pong Game

#### 1. **What are the main components of a Pong game?**
   - Game window
   - Paddles (Player 1 and Player 2)
   - Ball
   - Score display

#### 2. **How do we set up the game window?**
   - How do we initialize the Turtle screen?
   - What should be the size and background color of the game window?
   - How do we set the title of the window?

#### 3. **How do we create the paddles?**
   - What are the properties of the paddles (size, color, position)?
   - How do we create a paddle using the Turtle module?
   - How do we position the paddles on the screen?
   - How do we move the paddles up and down?

#### 4. **How do we create the ball?**
   - What are the properties of the ball (size, color, speed)?
   - How do we create a ball using the Turtle module?
   - How do we set the initial position and movement direction of the ball?

#### 5. **How do we implement paddle and ball collision detection?**
   - How do we check if the ball hits a paddle?
   - How do we make the ball bounce off the paddles?

#### 6. **How do we implement the ball bouncing off the walls?**
   - How do we check if the ball hits the top or bottom wall?
   - How do we make the ball bounce off the top and bottom walls?

#### 7. **How do we handle scoring?**
   - How do we check if the ball goes past a paddle (indicating a point for the opponent)?
   - How do we update the score?
   - How do we display the score on the screen?

#### 8. **How do we manage game controls?**
   - How do we move the paddles using the keyboard?
   - How do we link the key presses to paddle movement?

#### 9. **How do we implement the game loop?**
   - How do we continuously update the game state (ball movement, collision detection, scoring)?
   - How do we keep the game running until a certain condition is met (e.g., a player reaches a certain score)?

By breaking down the project into these questions and answering them step by step, you can approach the development of your Pong game systematically. Let me know if you need further details on any of these aspects!
